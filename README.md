# Food-Page
I’m excited to share my latest project—an interactive Food Landscape webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🌍🍕🥗 This dynamic web page features a smooth image slider showcasing different types of delicious food, making the browsing experience both engaging and visually appealing.
